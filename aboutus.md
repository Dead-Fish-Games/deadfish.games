Dead Fish Games was founded in 2020 by me (Ember Heartshine) and my partner, Lily Soul. It's really just a side hobby for me, but so far we've developed the following games:

- [Forsaken Planet](/fp)
- [Untitled Movement Game](/umg)

I'm just getting the hang of Jekyll and Github Pages, so this page might be a little threadbare for a while.
