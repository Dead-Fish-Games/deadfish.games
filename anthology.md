## Introduction

Welcome to Crystalpunk, a dark fantasy noir setting for the world's greatest roleplaying game! **Crystalpunk: Anthology** is intended to augment the exceptional [Crystalpunk Campaign Guide](https://plusthreepress.com/)  from Plus Three Press; however, most creatures and NPCs introduced in this supplement derive their stat blocks from information in the [System Reference Document 5.1](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd) as published by Wizards of the Coast and as such can be easily translated into other more traditional fantasy settings.

**Crystalpunk: Anthology is a fan work. Dead Fish Games is neither affiliated with Plus Three Press nor a licensor of content owned thereof.**
