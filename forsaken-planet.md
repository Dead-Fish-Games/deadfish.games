## Introduction

Well met, trader, and welcome to our world.

Earth has long since abandoned us. We are on our own, left to scrape out whatever meager existence we can find. You, and others like you, form the backbone of our society; Accumulating valuable **Food** and trading for **Resources** keeps all of us alive.

Welcome to the **Forsaken Planet**.

While playing **Forsaken Planet**, you will take on the role of a merchant transporting goods between—and responding to the needs of—the various **Colonies** around the board. The goal of **Forsaken Planet** is to have the most **food** (or **Resources** worth **food**) by the end of the game, making you the richest and most powerful trader on the planet.
