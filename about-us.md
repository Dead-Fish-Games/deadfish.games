We've also written the following tabletop RPG supplements:

- [Crystalpunk: Anthology](/anthology)

## So what *is* all this?

Dead Fish Games is an independent board game development partnership. We have no published games (yet), but we've been working on and prototyping a few games over the last few years.

Turns out a [worldwide pandemic that shuts down business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) is conductive to the creative process. Neat, huh?

## What's up with the name?

[Dead Fish](https://www.playworks.org/game-library/dead-fish/) is a children's game where one player counts down and the rest have to stay as still as possible once they reach 0 (imitating a dead fish). Anyone caught moving is "out," and has to help the first player find more moving players.

We played it a *lot* as a cool-down game during my local Boy Scout meetings.

That's it.

That's all.
